** Heads up **
There are two ways to use this module:
1) Using a FacebookSiteConfigMixin
This means that the credentials used to do the facebook request are saved to the database
2) using _config.php
This means the credentials used are stored in your code at mysite/_config.php

I recommend the former so that you can quickly change accounts/apps you're using in different environments.
So you're dev db has your test facebook wall, whereas your live site has the actual account you want to publish to.

If you decide to use FacebookSiteConfigMixin add the following to mysite/_config.php:
Object::add_extension('SiteConfig', 'FacebookSiteConfigMixin');
Object::add_extension('Page', 'FacebookDecorator'); // this could be any Page type
FacebookDecorator::set_facebook_fields(array('Page' => array('function_that_returns_parameters'))); // same as above

If you decide to use mysite/_config.php
Object::add_extension('Page', 'FacebookDecorator'); // this could be any Page type
FacebookDecorator::set_facebook_fields(array('Page' => array('function_that_returns_parameters'))); // same as above
PostToFacebook::set_facebook_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN);
PostToFacebook::set_facebook_app_id(APP_ID);
PostToFacebook::set_facebook_secret(APP_SECRET);
PostToFacebook::set_facebook_user_id(USER_ID);

The function that set_facebook_field references needs to return an array like so:
return array(
	'name' => $this->owner->Title,
	'link' => $this->owner->AbsoluteLink(),
);
It can also contain
photo
caption
etc

** How to use **

Firstly sign up for: http://developers.facebook.com/

Then create an app.

In "Select how your app integrates with Facebook" select "Website" and enter the name of the url the site will exist at.

Upload a icon image so that the post appears on the wall with your branding.

Now you need to copy the app_id and app secret and enter them either in your SiteConfig if you're using the mixin or in mysite/_config if you're not.

In order to publish to a users wall:
Set user_id as your user_id (see below if you're having trouble finding this)
Login to your Facebook account
Set access token to response from this url: (replaced with your app's id and secret)
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=APP_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL&scope=publish_stream&response_type=token

In order to publish to a page's wall
Set user_id as page's id (see below if you're having trouble finding this)
Make sure you are a page admin
Login to your Facebook account
Set access token to response from this url: (replaced with your app's id and secret)
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=APP_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URL&scope=publish_stream,manage_pages,offline_access&response_type=token

For an overview of the permissions available: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/permissions/

This access token will allow your user profile to post to the page's wall as you, not as the page.

In order to post as the page, use the access_token associated with the page in the response from:
https://graph.facebook.com/me/accounts?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN_FROMABOVE

** To find your facebook user_id **
http://www.facebook.com/editprofile.php?sk=picture hover over 'Edit Thumbnail' the id in the url is your user_id

** To find a pages' id **
Click on 'Use Facebook as a page' under the arrow dropdown on the far right
Click switch on the page you want to find the id for
Click 'edit info' at the top, this id in the url is the ID.
